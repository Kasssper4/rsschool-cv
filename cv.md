## __About me__

I am 18 years old, studying at the Minsk College of Electronics.
I recently got interested in programming. I tried to learn the C language, but I needed to see what I was creating, so I decided to stay on the frontend, which I am very pleased with.
My goals are to learn all the necessary technologies for further advancement in the field of front-end and, possibly, somewhere else.

## __Code example__

7th kyu task with codewars:
You are given a 2D array, composed of a colour and its 'common' association in each array element. The function you will write needs to return the colour as 'key' and association as its 'value'.
```
function colourAssociation(array){
  let result = array.map(([color, meaning]) => ({[color]: meaning}));
  return result;
}
```
